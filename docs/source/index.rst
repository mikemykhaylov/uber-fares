Welcome to Uber Fares Data Science documentation!
=================================================

Uber Fares is a Data Science and Machine Learning I worked on in my free time. Its goals were to analyse the dataset of 200k NYC Uber rides and build a model to predict the price of the trip. What exactly did I do?

- Downloaded the dataset from `Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset/code/>`_
- Formatted, cleaned, and enriched the dataset with additional data (NYC Neighborhoods and US Holidays)
- Created qualitative, spacial and temporal visualisations with Seaborn
- Iterated through several ML algorithms such as Polynomial regression, ElasticNet and Decision trees
- Tuned hyperparameters and trained the model on Google Cloud
- Created helpful documentation. Youâ€™re looking at it ðŸ˜‰
